## Hierarchy

<Description>

Typographical hierarchy indicates importance of content. Through size and weight, a strong hierarchy can provide clarity to a user to easily understand which level of the content they’re on. Sections need subsections, and those subsections may also need their own subsections. Visually, a user should be able to clearly tell a parent section from a child section simply by the relationship in size and weight between headings.

</Description>

## Type Styles

<Description>

To ensure consistency in typography sizes throughout Okta touchpoints, we’ve created a custom type scale paired with appropriate weights and line-heights.

</Description>


### Titles

<Description>

Titles are used to describe the main idea of a page, a section, or content that follows it. By default, header tags (`h1` through `h6`) use the corresponding title size.

## Weight

<Description>

In order to maintain consistency across browsers and typefaces, we specify weights by their numbered value, not name. Currently, the following weights are available.

</Description>

<Description>
  <figure class="ods-table--figure">
    <table class="ods-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="column">
            Weight
          </th>
          <th scope="column">
            Example
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <code>400</code>
          </td>
          <td class="type-sample--400">
            Normal (Book) 400
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <code>600</code>
          </td>
          <td class="type-sample--600">
            Bold (Medium) 600
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </figure>
</Description>

## Line length

<Description>

For inline and block level content, the line length should be 50 to 75 characters long. In order to facilitate consistency across designs, `max-width: $max-line-length` can be helpful.

</Description>

## Heading implementation

<Description>

When constructing a component or page, always start with <code>h1</code> for the topmost level of hierarchy.

Do not rely on heading elements for styling purposes; instead use classes like <code>.page--title</code> to style component headings.

Following these guidelines will ensure a clean document outline, which will increase both SEO performance and accessibility.
